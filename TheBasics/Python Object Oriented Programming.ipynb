    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics\n",
    "1. Attributes\n",
    "2. Behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "So a baby object will have\n",

    "* Behaviour - crying, eating and sleeping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of OOP\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming is built around the following principles\n",
    "* Inheritance - The process of using code from a super or parent class in child class.\n",
    "* Encapsulation - Hiding information of certain class or classes from others.\n",
    "* Polymorphism - This means one thing having many forms; in OOP it refers to the ability to use a method or function in multiple ways depending on the input data"
